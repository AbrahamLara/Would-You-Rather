# Would You Rather Project

This is my project for Udacity's React Redux course utilizing a provided dataset. This web app allows the user to play the "Would You Rather" game. The game is basically a user is given a question like "_Would You Rather_: [Option 1] or [optionTwo]?", and the user chooses one of the options and is then shown the percentage/amount of votes of each option and which option they selected.

This app also allows for a user to login as one of three pre-existing users. Once logged in they start off at the home page where they see the questions the user they logged in as have answered and which they haven't. Users can create their own question with options, answer their own or other's questions, view polls for questions they have already answered, and see how they place on the leader board.

_As an added bonus the web app is also responsive!_
